This is the .Net Standard targeting of the [`ToolsPack.Net`](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.Net/wiki)

My collection of many small useful code-snippet .net, wrapping in reusable library with unobtrusive dependencies.

Some of the most-used library are published on nuget.

- [See wiki document for brief introduction code](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.NetCore/wiki)
- [This sample](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.Net/wiki/ToolsPack.Net-Usage-Sample) demonstrates How usefull
  [`ToolsPack.Net`](https://github.com/duongphuhiep/ToolsPack.NetCore/wiki) is.

Navigate to the code and unit test samples for more information.

Most of the codes in this repository is already battle test / unit test on other projects. I won't port unit test from other project to this one.

## Remark

- I won't update much on this repository because the code is very stable. Nearly Zero-maintenance is needed.

- Maybe the `ToolsPack.Log4Net` is the only one need to upgrade beacause it depends on the [`log4net` package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/log4net/) which is occasionally upgraded. Evens if `ToolsPack.Log4Net` stuck with the old log4net version here, we can of course use it with the newer [`log4net` package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/log4net/)
